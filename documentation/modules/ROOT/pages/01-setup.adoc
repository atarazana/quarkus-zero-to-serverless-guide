[#getting-ready]
== Getting Ready for the labs

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don’t need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, access the CodeReady Workspaces instance and log in using the username and password you’ve been assigned (e.g. `%USER%/{LAB_PASS}`):

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Click on the name of the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number). You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green %USER%-namespace that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen.

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace:

You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  You’ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:

[NOTE]
====
If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
====

Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

[#login-to-openshift]
=== Login to OpenShift

Although your Eclipse Che workspace is running on the Kubernetes cluster, it’s running with a default restricted _Service Account_ that prevents you from creating most resource types. If you’ve completed other modules, you’re probably already logged in, but let’s login again: click on *Login to OpenShift*, and enter your given credentials:

* Username: `%USER%`
* Password: `{LAB_PASS}`

You should see something like this (the project names may be different):

[.console-output]
[source,console]
----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * %USER%-project

Using project "%USER%-project".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.

[NOTE]
====
After you log in using *Login to OpenShift*, the terminal is no longer usable as a regular terminal. You can close the terminal window. You will still be logged in when you open more terminals later!
====

[NOTE]
====
The Terminal window in CodeReady Workspaces. You can open a terminal window for any of the containers running in your Developer workspace. For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a terminal, you can use the **>_ New Terminal** command on the right:

Open a new terminal (as described above) and create the project:
[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes+",role="copypaste"]
----
oc new-project {PROJECT_NAME}
