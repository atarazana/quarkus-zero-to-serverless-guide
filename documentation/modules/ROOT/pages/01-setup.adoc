== Getting Ready For The Labs

Throughout the lab you will have to use both link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*^], an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^], and the *OpenShift Console*. In any case you will be authenticated by OpenShift Oauth Server, please use these credentials:

- *Username:* `{username}`
- *Password:* `{password}`


You will be using Red Hat Dev Spaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don’t need to explicitly save changes.

Let's get started! Access the *Dev Spaces* instance and log in using the username and password you’ve been assigned. Using the next link in a new tab, this links will take you to the IDE you'll be using and at the same time will create the workspace with all the tools needed.

[.console-input]
[source,text, subs="+attributes"]
----
{workspace_launch_url}

Please use the provided credentials, then please click on `Log in`.

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Click on the name of the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number). You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green {username}-namespace that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen.

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in your workspace:

NOTE: You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  You’ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do.

If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.

Many features of Dev Spaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

[#login-to-openshift]
=== Login to OpenShift

As we have already explained, your Dev Spaces environment is running on the Kubernetes cluster and terminals are already logged in so that you can run `oc` commands with out the need of logging in. Never the less tokens expire and if you leave your environment running longer than the expiration time you would need to log back in. If that is the case use the following command in a terminal window.

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes+",role="copypaste"]
----
oc login -u {username} -p {password} --server=https://api.{api-domain}
----

This is the expected result, should you needed to run previous command.

[.console-output]
[source,text,subs="attributes+"]
----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * {project_name}

Using project "{project_name}".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.

[NOTE]
====
The Terminal window in Dev Spaces. You can open a terminal window for any of the containers running in your Developer workspace. For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a terminal, you can use the **>_ New Terminal** command on the right:

Open a new terminal (as described above) and create the project:
