== Getting Ready For The Labs

Throughout the lab you will have to use both link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*^], an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^], and the *OpenShift Console*. In any case you will be authenticated by OpenShift Oauth Server, please use these credentials:

- *Username:* `{username}`
- *Password:* `{password}`


You will be using Red Hat Dev Spaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don’t need to explicitly save changes.

Let's get started! Access the *Dev Spaces* instance and log in using the username and password you’ve been assigned. Using the next link in a new tab, this links will take you to the IDE you'll be using and at the same time will create the workspace with all the tools needed.

Please use the provided credentials, then please click on `Log in`.

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Click on the name of the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number). You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green {username}-namespace that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen.

After a minute or two, you’ll land in your workspace, you'll be prompted to trust the authors, please trust us, at the end of the day it's only related to the lab content in a container running the IDE you see. Please check the box as in the picture and click on `Yes I trust the authors`:

[NOTE]
====
If the terminal or workspace appears to lag or doesn't respond, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
====

If you need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

Terminals in Dev Spaces work as in many IDEs and prominently as in VS Code, in a terminal window. The cool part is that in Dev Spaces the terminal window connects to a container running inside OpenShift!
====

Open a new terminal by clicking on the hamburger menu on the upper left corner, as in the next picture:
