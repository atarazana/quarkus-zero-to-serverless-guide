== Developing and Deploying a Quarkus Application on OpenShift

Welcome to the Quarkus from Zero to Serverless lab, there are other great Quarkus labs and tutorials out there but here you will experience the whole journey from coding to serverless. We will show you how to create a simple link:https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] application from the scratch (your Atomic Fruit Service) then how to package it as a Jar and as a native binary using link:https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel[Mandrel], later you will evolve your application by adding capabilities using the Quarkus extensions, including relational DB persistence, dependency injection, swagger UI, etc. later you will learn how to deploy it on OpenShift using maven and finally you will explore yet another way of deploying your application, this time using link:https://knative.dev[Knative].
